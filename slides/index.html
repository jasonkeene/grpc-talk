# A Tour of gRPC in Go

---

## What is gRPC?

- gRPC is a point to point RPC for req/resp and streaming.
- It has native Go, C and Java implementations, all other languages use C
  bindings.
- It is primarily used for internal communications but is seeing wide
  adoption in the Go ecosystem.
- It runs over h2, the future of the web!

---

## How do you use it?

- Create a protobuf definition file.
- Generate the client and server stubs.
- Implement the server interface to respond to requests.
- Register your server interface and start servicing requests!

# Demo Time!

---

## What if the consumers of my API don't speak h2?

- gRPC Gateway

---

## How to I protect my API from unauthorized access?

- Mutual Auth TLS
- Oauth2
- Custom Auth

---

## How do I scale this?

- Built in Load Balancing
- Custom Load Balancing

---

## How do I roll out new versions of my API?

- Protobuf package names and registration.

---

## What happens when things go wrong?

- gRPC reconnects for you! At least for req/resp.
- Each endpoint receives a context that can be used to teardown an entire
  chain of interactions between multiple systems.
- When streaming data to clients gRPC will quickly fill a client side buffer
  that allows clients to read at their own rate and servers to come up and down
  without the client being aware.

### This sounds nice but how does it compare with other technologies?

---

### REST/JSON

#### Pros

- Large adoption/effectively the defacto API for the internet.

#### Cons

- No streaming.
- Text based encoding.
- Text based transport (lots of repeated bytes over the wire).
- Implementations vary significantly.
- Roll your own clients.
- Auth is choose your own adventure.

---

### Websockets

#### Pros

- Bi-directional streaming!
- Large adoption with proxies and firewalls.

#### Cons

- Can not interleave data frames.
- Roll your own clients.
- Seems to be obsoleted by h2.

---

### zeromq, nanomsg/mangos

#### Pros

- A variety of messaging patterns, not just point to point (push/pull, pub/sub,
  req/resp).
- Everything reconnects for you (including streams).
- Load balancing built in.
- Socket style API.
- Implementations in various languages.

#### Cons

- Not suitable for the internet.
- Has not seen wide adoption.

---

### gRPC

#### Pros

- Native implementation in Go so no need for calling into cgo.
- Is seeing adoption in the Go ecosystem (etcd, prometheus, docker, etc).
- Built in muxing of multiple streams across a single TCP connection.
- Binary serialization and h2 header compression means less bytes over the
  wire.
- gRPC gateway for REST API support.
- Generate all the clients!
- Automatically reconnect if server goes down and comes back up.
- Built in authentication, encryption and message integrity.
- Built in support for compression (uses alot of CPU).

#### Cons

- Point to point. No PUB/SUB or Fan in/Fan out.
- Streaming does not auto reconnect.
- Does not work well on the internet (yet).
